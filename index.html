          <p class="small">
            A machine is a physical system using power to apply forces and
            control movement to perform an action. The term is commonly applied
            to artificial devices, such as those employing engines or motors,
            but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular
            machines. Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural
            forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal , or
            electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the
            actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces
            and movement. They can also include computers and sensors that
            monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical
            systems. Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple
            machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into
            motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force,
            known today as mechanical advantage.[1] Modern machines are complex
            systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control
            components and include interfaces for convenient use. Examples
            include: a wide range of vehicles, such as trains, automobiles,
            boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including
            computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well
            as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and
            robots.

        <p id="head">Something about Fluid Mechanics</p>
        <p id="para">
          Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the mechanics
          of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them.It has
          applications in a wide range of disciplines, including mechanical,
          aerospace, civil, chemical and biomedical engineering, geophysics,
          oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, and biology. It can be
          divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest; and fluid
          dynamics, the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion. It is a
          branch of continuum mechanics, a subject which models matter without
          using the information that it is made out of atoms; that is, it models
          matter from a macroscopic viewpoint rather than from microscopic.
          Fluid mechanics, especially fluid dynamics, is an active field of
          research, typically mathematically complex. Many problems are partly
          or wholly unsolved and are best addressed by numerical methods,
          typically using computers. A modern discipline, called computational
          fluid dynamics (CFD), is devoted to this approach.Particle image
          velocimetry, an experimental method for visualizing and analyzing
          fluid flow, also takes advantage of the highly visual nature of fluid
          flow.
